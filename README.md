# Semester-Project-Report
This is the report of my semester project, "Solitons and Frequency Combs in Quantum Cascade Lasers", in Jérôme Faist's Group under the supervision of Paolo Micheletti. The goal of this project is to produce solitons and frequency combs in a variety of QCLs with varying active region designs. The ring QCL and a single-mode injected double ridge QCL showed promising results and were scrutinized in more detail. Methods include FTIR, SWIFT spectroscopy, and general spectrograms. We were not able to produce solitons, however frequency combs were found, and the effect of the single-mode injector was studied further in detail. We found interesting hysteretical effects.
